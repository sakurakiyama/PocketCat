## Pocket Cat

Pocket Cat is a web game that combines the nostalgia of the 90's; the simplcity of Tamagotchu and the retro charm of Gameboy. Your virtual cat, Jameson (inspired by my cat), hatches and you'll need to take care of him by feeding him, giving him attention and cleaning up after him.

## Animations

The animations in this game are crafted through the utilization of CSS spritesheets. This technique allows for a smooth and visually engaging gaming experience, where various actions and movements of characters like Jameson come to life on the screen. By condensing multiple animation frames into a single image, spritesheets make the game visually dynamic and efficient. The images in this app were generated using <a href='https://www.piskelapp.com/'>Piskel</a>.
